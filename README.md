# kotlin-spring-starter

Starter project containing most often used configuration for spring boot. When developing Spring Boot apps,
I noticed that there are certain patterns, such as security configuration, that I have to do every time when I start
a new project. Therefore I decided to create a repository into which I would like to put all the default configuration
which I usually use.
